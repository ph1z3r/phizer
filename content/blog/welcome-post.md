# Welcome to My Security Research Blog

Hello and welcome to my security research blog! This is where I'll be sharing my findings, tutorials, and thoughts on various cybersecurity topics.

## What to Expect

On this blog, you'll find:

- **Vulnerability Research**: Detailed write-ups of vulnerabilities I've discovered
- **Technical Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides on security tools and techniques
- **Security Analysis**: Reviews of recent security incidents and how they could have been prevented
- **Tool Development**: Insights into security tools I'm developing

## My Approach to Responsible Disclosure

I'm a firm believer in responsible disclosure. When I discover vulnerabilities in software or systems, I follow these principles:

1. Notify the vendor directly with full details
2. Provide reasonable time for patching
3. Assist with remediation if requested
4. Publish details only after patches are available

## Future Topics

Some topics I plan to cover in upcoming posts:

- Web application security testing methodology
- Common SSRF vulnerabilities and prevention
- Building your own security testing lab
- Analyzing obfuscated malware

## Stay Connected
