# Exploring Windows Security: A New Journey

Welcome to the Windows Security section of my blog! This is where I’ll explore the intricacies of Windows internals, common attack vectors, and defensive techniques.

## What to Expect

Here, I’ll be posting about:

- **Windows Internals**: Deep dives into how Windows components work
- **Offensive Techniques**: Red team tactics like privilege escalation and persistence
- **Defensive Strategies**: Blue team methods, EDR evasion analysis, and hardening guides
- **Detection & Response**: Writing Sigma rules, analyzing logs, and using tools like Sysmon

## Responsible Disclosure Reminder

Any vulnerabilities I find related to Windows or associated tools will be disclosed responsibly:

1. Reported privately to the relevant vendor
2. Allowing ample time for remediation
3. Supporting patch efforts if needed
4. Public disclosure only post-patch

## Upcoming Topics

Planned blog posts include:

- Hunting for LOLBins in enterprise environments  
- Common misconfigurations in Active Directory  
- Hands-on with Windows Event Logs for DFIR  
- Exploring AMSI bypass techniques  

## Stay in Touch
