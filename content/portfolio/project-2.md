# IoT Firmware Security Analysis Framework

## Project Overview

This framework provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing IoT device firmware for security vulnerabilities. It automates the extraction, analysis, and reporting process to quickly identify common security issues in embedded systems.

## Key Features

- **Firmware Extraction**: Automated extraction of filesystem from various firmware formats
- **Static Analysis**: Identification of hardcoded credentials, encryption keys, and vulnerable functions
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Emulation environment for runtime testing
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Automated detection of common IoT vulnerabilities
- **Reporting**: Detailed reports with vulnerability explanations and remediation suggestions

## Technical Details

The framework combines reverse engineering tools with custom analysis scripts to provide deep insights into IoT firmware security. It uses Ghidra for disassembly and decompilation, along with custom Python scripts for vulnerability pattern matching.

### Tool Components

1. **Firmware Extractor**: Handles various firmware packaging formats
2. **Binary Analyzer**: Identifies vulnerable functions and patterns in binaries
3. **Configuration Auditor**: Checks for insecure default configurations
4. **Network Protocol Analyzer**: Tests implemented network protocols for vulnerabilities
5. **Report Generator**: Creates comprehensive security reports

## Research Findings

Using this framework, I've discovered several critical vulnerabilities in consumer IoT devices:

- Hardcoded administrative credentials in smart home devices
- Insufficient encryption in IoT communication protocols
- Buffer overflow vulnerabilities in firmware update mechanisms
- Insecure boot processes allowing unauthorized code execution

## Documentation and Usage

Full documentation for this framework is available in the GitHub repository, including installation instructions, usage examples, and guidelines for extending the tool with custom analyzers.
