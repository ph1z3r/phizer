## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests for the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- **Low False Positives**: Advanced verification techniques to minimize false positives
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates comprehensive HTML and PDF reports
- **CI/CD Integration**: Can be integrated into development pipelines
- **Customizable Rules**: Extend with your own vulnerability detection rules

## Technical Implementation

The scanner is built with Python and uses a modular architecture to allow for easy extension. It employs headless browser automation for accurate vulnerability verification and uses a combination of static analysis and dynamic testing.
